            <strong>Senior Technical and Project Lead – ExpertFlow (2025–Present)</strong>
            <p>
                As a Senior Technical and Project Lead, I lead diverse teams of developers, designers, and business analysts to deliver high-quality software solutions. My key responsibilities include project planning, client communication, troubleshooting, and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. My work mainly involves cloud-based solutions and CRM software integration for large-scale enterprises.

            <strong>Technical Lead – TechCorp (2023–2025)</strong>
            <p>
                At TechCorp, I contributed to the development of an enterprise-level system that streamlined business operations across multiple departments. I worked closely with clients to understand their needs and develop customized solutions that fit their business model. I also mentored junior developers and provided guidance on best practices for software development and agile methodologies.
